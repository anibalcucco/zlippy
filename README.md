# Zlippy

## Description

Zendesk App to let agents interact with the completions endpoint of the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction/overview) inside the ticket page and optionally append the responses to the comment box.

Zlippy comes from "Zendesk Clippy" (the old Microsoft Office Assistant):
